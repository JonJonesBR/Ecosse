# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical production readiness issues in the web application, focusing on eliminating CDN dependencies, fixing missing resources, and optimizing performance systems. The goal is to ensure the application is production-ready with proper asset management, complete file structure, and robust performance optimizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer deploying to production, I want to eliminate external CDN dependencies, so that the application can run reliably without external network dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads in production THEN the system SHALL use locally installed Tailwind CSS instead of CDN
2. WHEN Tailwind CSS is processed THEN the system SHALL generate optimized CSS files with only used classes
3. IF the application is in development mode THEN the system SHALL optionally allow CDN usage for faster development

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer running tests, I want all verification files to be present and accessible, so that the test suite runs without 404 errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files are executed THEN the system SHALL find all referenced verification files
2. WHEN a verification file is missing THEN the system SHALL either create it or remove the reference
3. IF verification files exist THEN the system SHALL ensure they contain valid test implementations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want optimized performance systems, so that the interface responds smoothly and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resize events occur THEN the system SHALL properly debounce layout updates to prevent excessive recalculations
2. WHEN elements are outside the viewport THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading to improve performance
3. WHEN performance monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide accurate metrics and monitoring capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want a robust build system, so that production deployments are consistent and optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL process and optimize all CSS and JavaScript assets
2. WHEN assets are processed THEN the system SHALL generate minified versions for production use
3. IF the build process encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and monitoring, so that production issues can be identified and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in production THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately without exposing sensitive information
2. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for debugging
3. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain application stability and provide fallback behavior
