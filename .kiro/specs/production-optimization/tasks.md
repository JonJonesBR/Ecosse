  - Write unit tests for TailwindProcessor functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 3. Implement file validation system for missing resources

  - Create FileValidator class to scan for missing file references
  - Implement detection of 404-causing script and resource references
  - Add functionality to identify missing verification files
  - Write unit tests for file validation logic
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 4. Generate missing verification files and update references

  - Create stub implementations for missing verify-task\*-completion.js files
  - Implement automatic generation of missing verification scripts
  - Update HTML and JS file references to point to existing files
  - Write tests to verify all references resolve correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 5. Enhance performance optimization system with proper debouncing

  - Fix debouncing implementation in performance optimization system
  - Implement proper event throttling for resize events
  - Add configurable debounce delays for different event types
  - Write tests to verify debouncing reduces event processing
  - _Requirements: 3.1_

- [ ] 6. Implement lazy loading system with intersection observer

  - Create LazyLoadingManager class using Intersection Observer API
  - Implement lazy loading for elements outside viewport

  - _Requirements: 3.2_

- [ ] 7. Create performance monitoring and metrics system

  - Implement PerformanceMonitor class to track system metrics
  - Add monitoring for layout calculations, resize events, and lazy loading
  - Create performance dashboard for debugging and optimization
  - Write tests to verify monitoring accuracy and performance impact
  - _Requirements: 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Enhance existing build system with new optimization features

  - Extend ProductionBuilder class to include Tailwind processing
  - Integrate file validation into build pipeline
  - Add performance optimization steps to build process
  - Create production validation checks in build system
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 9. Implement error handling and fallback systems

  - Add comprehensive error handling to all optimization systems
  - Implement fallback behavior for failed optimizations
  - Create error logging and reporting for production issues
  - Write tests to verify error handling and fallback behavior
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 10. Create production deployment configuration and scripts

  - Create deployment scripts that use optimized build process
  - Add environment detection to switch between development and production modes
  - Implement asset manifest generation for cache busting
  - Write integration tests for complete production deployment pipeline
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 11. Update HTML template to use local assets in production

  - Modify index.html to conditionally load local vs CDN resources
  - Implement environment-based asset loading logic
  - Update script references to use generated local files
  - Write tests to verify correct asset loading in both environments
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 12. Integrate all systems and perform end-to-end testing
  - Wire together all optimization systems in main application
  - Create comprehensive integration tests for production build
  - Verify elimination of all CDN dependencies in production mode
  - Test performance improvements and validate metrics
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1_
